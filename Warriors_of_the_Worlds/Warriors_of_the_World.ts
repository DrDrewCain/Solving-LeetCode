/**
 * Here are the instructions on how to play the game:
 * 
 * 1. Enter your userName.
 * 
 * 2. Choose your character. You can either be Warrior or Wizard. The game will keep prompting you until you enter a valid character.
 * 
 * 3. Answer the question "Is Warrior stronger than Wizard and his minions?" with either "yes" or "no".
 * 
 * 4. Guess a number between 1 and 100. The computer will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
 * 
 * 5. If your guess is equal to the random number and you answered the question correctly, you win! Otherwise, you lose.
 * 
 * I hope you enjoy the game!
